## About this project

In this project, I used the giphy api to create a search app for celebrity gifs. There are few celebrities identified at the start, and users can add more buttons by submitting celebrity names to a form. 

## How it works
This app uses Javascript and AJAX to pull content from the giphy API and dynamically change the HTML file. The app uses event listeners to listen for user clicks and then make changes to the HTML based on what was clicked.

There are two primary functions in this app: 
1. renderButton(), which shows the current set of celebrity buttons
2. search(celebrity), which displays celebrity gifs when the user clicks on a button.

There is also an event listener that creates new buttons when users submit a new name. 

## Known Issues
